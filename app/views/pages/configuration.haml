  %h2 Configuration

  %p
    Hound uses the
    #{link_to "thoughtbot style guide", "https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style"}
    by default, unless you configure it to use your own style guide.

  %p
    Configure Hound for Ruby, CoffeeScript, JavaScript, and SCSS
    by following these instructions.

  %h3 Ruby

  %p
    Hound uses #{link_to "RuboCop", "https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop"}
    internally so you can configure Hound by adding a
    #{link_to "RuboCop config", "https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/config/enabled.yml"}
    to your project and adding the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project.

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        ruby:
          config_file: config/.rubocop.yml

  %p
    To disable Ruby style checking, add the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        ruby:
          enabled: false

  %h3 CoffeeScript

  %p
    Hound uses #{link_to "CoffeeLint", "http://www.coffeelint.org/"}
    internally so you can configure Hound by adding a
    #{link_to "CoffeeLint config", "https://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint/blob/master/coffeelint.json"}
    to your project and adding the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project.

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        coffee_script:
          config_file: config/.coffeelint.json

  %p
    To disable CoffeeScript style checking, add the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        coffee_script:
          enabled: false

  %h3 JavaScript

  %p
    Hound uses #{link_to "JSHint", "https://github.com/jshint/jshint/"}
    internally so you can configure Hound by adding a
    #{link_to "JSHint config", "https://github.com/thoughtbot/hound/blob/master/config/style_guides/javascript.json"}
    file to your project and adding the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project.

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        java_script:
          config_file: config/.jshint.json

  %p
    If you are looking to ignore certain JavaScript files from being checked for
    style issues you can set the
    %em.code ignore_file
    option in the
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project. This option should be set to a file which
    defines what files or patterns should be ignored during style checking.

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        java_script:
          ignore_file: config/.javascript_ignore

  %p
    Each line in the
    %em.code .javascript_ignore
    file can specify a pattern for file names to ignore.

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        vendor/assets/javascripts/**.js

  %p
    To disable JavaScript style checking, add the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        java_script:
          enabled: false

  %h3 SCSS

  %p
    Hound uses #{link_to "SCSS-Lint", "https://github.com/causes/scss-lint"}
    internally so you can configure Hound by adding a
    #{link_to "SCSS config", "https://github.com/causes/scss-lint/blob/master/config/default.yml"}
    file to your project and adding the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project.

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        scss:
          config_file: config/scss.yml

  %p
    To disable SCSS style checking, add the following to
    %em.code .hound.yml
    in the root of your project

    %code.code-block
      :preserve
        scss:
          enabled: false
