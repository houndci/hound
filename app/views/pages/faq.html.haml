  %h2 Frequently Asked Questions

  %h3 Why isn't Hound commenting on my pull request?
  %ul.debug-hound-not-working
    %li.debug-steps
      Note that Hound only comments when he finds a style violation. Ensure
      that changes made in your pull request actually contain style guide
      violations.
    %li.debug-steps
      Alternatively, tools like RuboCop and JSHint can be used to
      check for style guide violations locally, given your configuration.
    %li.debug-steps
      Ensure that configuration is setup to report on the specific violations.
      See the
      = link_to('configuration', configuration_path)
      page for more info.
    %li.debug-steps
      Be sure your PR is of a manageable size. The Github API has access
      limits which can affect the number of violations reported. Anecdotally,
      we've seen pull requests with more than 250 changed files get incomplete
      responses.

  %h3 Why doesn't Hound list a repo on which I'm a collaborator?
  %p
    Only GitHub repository owners can enable Hound for style guide reviews.
  %p
    For more information, see GitHub's documentation on permission levels for
    = link_to('organization repos', 'https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization-repository/')
    and
    = link_to('user account repos.', 'https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/')

  %h3 How secure is my code now that Hound has access?
  %p
    Please see our
    = link_to('security page.',
      'https://github.com/thoughtbot/hound/blob/master/doc/SECURITY.md')

  %h3 Do you offer a trial subscription?
  %p
    We currently don't have a trial subscription level. We suggest trying it
    out on open-sourced repos first, since these can be enabled free of charge.


  %h3 Can I have Hound check my entire repository for style?
  %p
    No, and we don't recommend doing so. Our rule is "Don't rewrite existing
    code to follow the style guide." See the
    = link_to('thoughtbot style guide.',
      'https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides#guides')
  %p
    It can be dangerous to re-write a lot of code for just style reasons. It
    can introduce functional regressions, which are a higher-level concern than
    style.
  %p
    We believe the right approach is to convert a codebase over time, one pull
    request at a time, to conform to a style guide. Only focus on style in
    diffs and make smaller changes that ideally have tests associated with
    them.
  %p
    If you'd still like to analyze your whole repo, try using
    = link_to('Rubocop', 'https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop')
    locally.

  %h3 Do you offer GitHub Enterprise support?
  %p
    Not at the current time. A user has shared their method of getting it to
    work
    = link_to('here in this GitHub issue',
      'https://github.com/thoughtbot/hound/issues/426')
    but it is an not officially supported approach.

  %h3 How do I unsubscribe from Hound?
  %p
    If you are no longer satisfied with Hound, you can cancel your subscription
    by disabling your repo on
    = link_to('the repo page.', repos_path)
