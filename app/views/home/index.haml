      Why does style matter?

          %h4.home-heading--small Convention
          %p
            Defining and sticking with a style guide helps reduce the amount of
            decisions that developers need to make when writing code, helping to
            keep their focus on logic, not semantics and formatting.

        .home-importance-text
          %h4.home-heading--small Consistency
          %p
            When every line of code is written in the same style, the whole
            codebase becomes easier to read, understand and de-bug. It also
            helps prevent areas of the codebase from being “owned” by one
            person's unique style vs. the team.

          %p
            A clean codebase is a reflection of a cohesive team. It gives the
            impression of a team working well together towards a common goal,
            rather than individual developers working independently.

          Hound integrates with your existing workflow by reviewing and commenting
          on code the moment a GitHub pull request is opened or updated.

          give the kind of code review that humans are best at giving.

        are the result of years of utilization in software projects at
