== 2.6.2 / 2015-09-13

* Bugs:
  * Emilio Losada (@losadaem) fixed an error where +each_with_object+'s block
    parameters are the inverse of those used by +inject+. Resolves
    {#107}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/107] with pull
    request {#108}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/108].
  * Matt Beedle (@mattbeedle) fixed a typo in MIME::Type::Columnar negatively
    affecting people who use the +use_instead+ functionality. Resolved in
    {#109}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/109].
* Documentation:
  * Juanito Fatas (@JuanitoFatas) fixed a documentation issue with the README
    not properly linking internally on the generated rdoc source. Resolved with
    {#105}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/105].
* Development:
  * Fixed a minor issue in the IANA registry parser that would generate empty
    +text+ xrefs if the +text+ section was empty.

== 2.6.1 / 2015-05-25

* Bugs:
  * Make columnar store handle all supported extensions, not just the first.
    Resolved in {#103}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/103]
    by Jeremy Evans (@jeremyevans).
  * Avoid circular require when using the columnar store. Resolved in
    {#102}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/102] by
    Jeremy Evans (@jeremyevans).

== 2.6 / 2015-05-25

* New Feature:
  * Columnar data storage for the MIME::Types registry, contributed by Jeremy
    Evans (@jeremyevans). Reduces default memory use substantially (the mail
    gem drops from 19 Mib to about 3 Mib). Resolves
    {#96}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/96],
    {#94}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/94],
    {#83}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/83]. Partially
    addresses {#64}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/64]
    and {#62}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/62].
* Development:
  * Removed caching of deprecation messages in preparation for mime-types 3.0.
    Now, deprecated methods will always warn their deprecation instead of only
    warning once.
  * Added a logger for deprecation messages.
  * Renamed <tt>lib/mime.rb</tt> to <tt>lib/mime/deprecations.rb</tt> to not
    conflict with the {mime}[https://rubygems.org/gems/mime] gem on behalf of
    the maintainers of the {Praxis Framework}[http://praxis-framework.io/].
    Provided by Josep M. Blanquer (@blanquer),
    {#100}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/100].
  * Added the columnar data conversion tool, also provided by Jeremy Evans.
* Documentation:
  * Improved documentation and ensured that all deprecated methods are marked
    as such in the documentation.
* Development:
  * Added more Ruby variants to Travis CI.
  * Silenced deprecation messages for internal tools. Noisy deprecations are
    noisy, but that's the point.

== 2.5 / 2015-04-25

* Bugs:
  * David Genord (@albus522) fixed a bug in loading MIME::Types cache where a
    container loaded from cache did not have the expected +default_proc+,
    {#86}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/86].
  * Richard Schneeman (@schneems) provided a patch that substantially reduces
    unnecessary allocations.
* Documentation:
  * Tibor Szolár (@flexik) fixed a typo in the README,
    {#82}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/82]
  * Fixed {#80}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/80],
    clarifying the relationship of MIME::Type#content_type and
    MIME::Type#simplified, with Ken Ip (@kenips).
* Development:
  * Juanito Fatas (@JuanitoFatas) enabled container mode on Travis CI,
    {#87}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/87].
* Moved development to a mime-types organization under
  {mime-types/ruby-mime-types}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types].

== 2.4.3 / 2014-10-21

* Bugs:
  * Restored Ruby 1.9.2 support by using +private_constant+ conditionally.
    Fixes {#77}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/77] found by
    Kris Leech (@krisleech). The conditional use of +private_constant+ here
    will be removed for mime-types 3.0, when Ruby 1.9.2 support will be
    unconditionally removed.

== 2.4.2 / 2014-10-15

* Bugs:
  * Aaron Patterson (@tenderlove) found a loading bug and provided a fix that
    nearly doubled registry load performance
    ({#74}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/74]).
  * Godfrey Chan (@chancancode) provided a prophylactic security fix to use
    <tt>JSON.parse</tt> instead of <tt>JSON.load</tt> in
    {#75}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/75]. This provides a
    20% improvement over the already improved result, resulting in a total 55%
    performance boost.

== 2.4.1 / 2014-10-07

mime-types 2.4 was pulled.

* Bugs:
  * Restored the extension sort order from mime-types 1.25.1 and modified
    MIME::Type#extensions= to no longer sort extensions when set. This resolves
    {#71}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/71] and should fix
    Paperclip.
* API Changes:
  * Added MIME::Type#preferred_extension to return the preferred extension for
    the MIME type. This should be used in preference to the current mechanism
    used by many clients, <tt>type.extensions.first</tt>. This will allow the
    implementation to change over time.
  * Added MIME::Type#friendly based on the concept presented by Łukasz Śliwa’s
    {friendly_mime}[https://github.com/lukaszsliwa/friendly_mime] gem. The
    initial English data for this is pulled from +friendly_mime+.
  * Added MIME::Type#i18n_key and MIME::Type.i18n_key to represent and convert
    MIME content types as translation keys for the I18n library.

* MIME Type Development Tools:
  * Adding documentation to conversion methods.
  * Adding some robustness to missing Nokogiri support.
  * Extending coverage to fully cover new code. Tests now cover all of
    mime-types.

== 2.3 / 2014-05-23

* Bugs:
  * Fixed a bug in <tt>MIME::Types#type_for</tt> where type specifications that
    did not match a MIME::Type would be returned as +nil+ inside the returned
    array. This was incorrect behaviour as those values should not have been
    returned, resulting in an empty array.
* MIME Type Development Tools:
  * As always, there are bugs in the IANA registry because it's manually
    maintained. Some robustness has been added to properly writing file
    template references where the file template reference is not a full media
    type specification (e.g., 'amr-wb\+' instead of 'audio/amr-wb\+').
  * Both the IANA and Apache import tools were unnecessarily case-sensitive in
    matching against already-existing MIME types, resulting in extra work to
    weed out duplicates that differed only in the case of the canonical content
    type. This has been fixed.

== 2.2 / 2014-03-14

* Clarified contribution guidelines for MIME types. Resolves
  {#57}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/57].
* Fixed a small bug where deprecated methods would warn of deprecation when
  called by internal methods. Resolves
  {#60}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/60].
* Dropped Code Climate; added Coveralls for test coverage reports.
* Removing external references to RubyForge, as it is shutting down. Resolves
  {#59}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/59].

== 2.1 / 2014-01-25

* API Changes (MIME::Type):
  * Added MIME::Type#xrefs and MIME::Type#xref_urls that have better handling
    of types of reference information. MIME::Type#references= has been
    deprecated. In a future release, both MIME::Type#references will be turned
    into a short-hand view on MIME::Type#xrefs, MIME::Type#urls will be an
    alias for MIME::Type#xref_urls, and MIME::Type#references= will be removed.
* New or Updated MIME Types:
  * This information is now tracked in History-Types.rdoc.
* MIME Type Development Tools:
  * The IANA registry format changed, breaking the IANA registry tool
    previously used. Rewrote IANADownloader and IANADownloader::Parser as
    IANARegistryParser using the XML form.
  * The LTSW list has been dropped as it has not been updated since 2002.
  * The default Apache MIME types configuration list is now used to enrich MIME
    type data with additional extension information.

== 2.0 / 2013-10-27

* API Changes (General):
  * mime-types is no longer compatible with Ruby 1.8. Additionally, for its
    YAML operations (normally development and test), it requires a YAML parser
    that conforms to the Psych parser, not the Syck parser. This would only be
    a problem with an alternative Ruby 1.9.2 interpreter that does not
    implement the Psych parser conventions by requiring +psych+.
  * MIME::InvalidContentType has been renamed to
    MIME::Type::InvalidContentType.
* API Changes (MIME::Type):
  * Construction of a MIME::Type can be with any of the following objects:
    * An array containing a valid content type identifier and an optional array
      of extensions. This allows MIME::Type.new to be used instead of
      MIME::Type.from_array for the most common use-case. Fixes
      {#43}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/43].
    * A Hash containing the output of MIME::Type#to_h, as would be deserialized
      from the JSON representation of a MIME::Type. This replaces
      MIME::Type.from_hash using a different parameter set.
    * Another MIME::Type.
    * A content type identifier string.
  * Assignment of an invalid encoding to MIME::Type#encoding= will raise a
    MIME::Type::InvalidEncoding exception rather than a plain ArgumentError.
  * MIME::Type#url has been renamed to MIME::Type#references.
  * MIME::Type#use_instead is now tracked as its own attribute, not as part of
    MIME::Type#docs.
  * MIME::Type#system, MIME::Type#system?, MIME::Type#platform?,
    MIME::Type#to_a, MIME::Type#to_hash, MIME::Type.from_array,
    MIME::Type.from_hash, and MIME::Type.from_mime_type have been deprecated
    for removal.
  * Implemented YAML object encoding and decoding methods,
    MIME::Type#encode_with and MIME::Type#init_with.
  * Implemented JSON hash encoding methods.
  * Added MIME::Type#add_extensions to easily add extensions to a MIME::Type.
    Fixes {#44}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/44].
* API Changes (MIME::Types):
  * MIME type caching has been extracted to its own class. It is structurally
    similar to what was introduced with mime-types 1.25, but is no longer
    considered an experimental interface.
  * MIME type loading has been extracted to its own class. Loading has changed
    substantially.
  * MIME::Types#[] accepts a new filter flag, :registered. The :platform flag
    has been deprecated.
  * The MIME::Types#type_for platform parameter has been deprecated.
  * Added the ability for MIME::Types#type_for produce results for multiple
    filenames or extensions by providing an array as the first parameter. Fixes
    {#42}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/42].
  * MIME::Types#add_type_variant and MIME::Types#index_extensions have been
    deprecated as public methods. They will be private in a future version.
  * MIME::Types#defined_types, MIME::Types.cache_file,
    MIME::Types.add_type_variant, and MIME::Types.index_extensions have been
    deprecated for removal.
* Default Registry Changes:
  * The default registry is now a file in the directory data/, located via
    MIME::Types::Loader::PATH. +PATH+ is defined in the file
    lib/mime/types/path.rb so that system packagers only have to modify one
    file in order to put the registry in a location that is not where a gem
    version of mime-types would expect it. This resolves issue
    {#36}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/36], reported by
    @postmodern.
  * The default registry is now a single file in JSON format. This resolves
    issue {#28}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/28] reported
    by @jasonlor (an error with mime-types in MacRuby).
  * The default registry is compiled from YAML files in type-lists/, resolving
    issue {#37}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/37]
    reported by @postmodern requesting an easier-to-edit format.
* New or Updated MIME Types:
  * Major updates to the registered MIME type list from IANA using the improved
    developer tools.
  * Added:
    * application/xhtml\+xml (HTML5)
    * multipart/x-mixed-replace (HTML5)
    * application/vnd.apple.pkpass (Apple PassBook) with extension pkpass.
  * Modified:
    * application/gzip (RFC6713) added extension (gz) and encoding.
    * application/epub\+zip is not a registered MIME type.
    * application/rss\+xml is not a registered MIME type.
    * application/x-director reported incorrect extensions.
    * application/x-gzip marked as obsolete (use application/gzip instead).
    * application/x-maker marked as obsolete (use application/vnd.framemaker
      instead).
    * image/webp is not a registered MIME type; added a URL to Google's
      proposed standard document.
    * text/html added URL to the HTML5 specification.
    * text/cache-manifest added URL to the HTML5 specification.
    * text/plain (VMS .doc files) marked as non-standard. This type will be
      merged with the standard text/plain type in a future release.
    * Added md, markdown, rst, and textile extensions to text/plain.
* MIME Type Development Tools:
  * The benchmarking task has been moved mostly to support/benchmarker.rb.
  * A task for SimpleCov coverage has been added (<tt>rake test:coverage</tt>).
  * IANA type registry downloading has been substantially improved and the
    implementation no longer resides in the Rakefile; it has instead been moved
    to support/iana_downloader.rb. This takes advantage of the new YAML
    encoding functionality to update added or modified MIME types
    non-destructively in <tt>type-lists/</tt> by default.
  * Rake tasks <tt>convert:yaml:json</tt> and <tt>convert:json:yaml</tt>
    provide functionality to convert the human-editable YAML format in
    <tt>type-lists/</tt> to the JSON format in <tt>data/</tt> and vice-versa.
    This is powered by support/convert.rb.

== 1.25 / 2013-08-30

* New Features:
  * Adding lazy loading and caching functionality to the default data based on
    work done by Greg Brockman (gdb).
* Bugs:
  * Force the default internal application encoding to be used when reading the
    MIME types database. Based on a change by briangamble, found in the rapid7
    fork.
* New extensions:
  * mjpeg (video/x-motion-jpeg) based on a change by punkrats, found in the
    vidibus fork.
* Modernized Minitest configuration.

== 1.24 / 2013-08-14

* Code Climate:
  * Working on improving the quality of the mime-types codebase through the use
    of Code Climate.
  * Simplified MIME::Type.from_array to make more assumptions about assignment.
* Documentation:
  * LeoYoung <mrleoyoung@gmail.com> pointed out that the README.rdoc contained
    examples that could never possibly work because MIME::Types#[] returns (for
    all the versions I have handy) an array, not a single type. I have updated
    README.rdoc to reflect this.
* Removed Nokogiri as a declared development dependency. It is still required
  if you're going to use the IANA parser functionality, but it is not necessary
  for most development purposes. This has been removed to ensure that Travis CI
  passes on Ruby 1.8.7.
* New MIME Types:
  * 7zip (application/x-7z-compressed). Fixes a request by @kodram.
    {#32}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/32]
  * application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Fixes a request by @alexkwolfe.
    {#39}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/39]
  * Various new MIME types from IANA:
    * application/mbms-schedule\+xml from 3GPP and Turcotte.
    * application/provenance\+xml from W3C and Herman.
    * application/session-info from 3GPP and Firmin.
    * application/urc-grpsheet\+xml, application/urc-targetdesc\+xml,
      application/uisocketdesc\+xml from Zimmermann.
    * application/api\+json from Klabnik.
    * application/vnd.etsi.pstn\+xml from Han and Belling.
    * application/vnd.fujixerox.docuworks.container from Tashiro.
    * application/vnd.windows.devicepairing from Dandawate.
    * video/vnd.radgamettools.bink and video/vnd.radgamettools.smacker from
      Andersson.
* Updated MIME Types:
  * RFC 6960 was adopted (application/ocsp-request and application/ocsp-response).

== 1.23 / 2013-04-20

* New Feature:
  * Arnaud Meuret (@ameuret) suggested that it could be useful if the MIME type
    collection was enumerable, so he implemented it in
    {#30}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/30]. Thanks for
    the contribution!
* Updated MIME Types:
  * RFC6910 was adopted (application/call-completion).
  * RFC6902 was adopted (application/json-patch\+json).
  * RFC6917 was adopted (application/mrb-consumer\+xml,
    application/mrb-publish\+xml).
  * RFC6922 was adopted (application/sql).
  * RFC2560 is being
    {updated}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pkix-rfc2560bis].
* Administrivia:
  * The gemspec now includes information about the licenses under which the
    mime-types gem is available.
  * Using hoe-gemspec2 instead of hoe-gemspec.

== 1.22 / 2013-03-30

* New MIME Types:
  * Added support for 3FR (Hasselblad raw images) files. MIME-Type was obtained
    by looking at exif data with exiftool. Thanks to cgat for these changes.
    {#27}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/27]
* Updated MIME Types:
    * Pulled the latest updates from the IANA MIME-Type registry.
* Added support for Ruby 2.0 with Travis CI.

== 1.21 / 2013-02-09

* New MIME Types:
  * Various new or updated MIME types by Garret Alfert:
    application/vnd.ms-fontobject, .eot; application/x-chrome-extension, .crx;
    application/x-web-app-manifest\+json, .webapp; application/x-xpinstall,
    .xpi; image/svg\+xml, .svg, .svgz; image/webp, .webp; text/cache-manifest,
    .appcache, .manifest.
    #{24}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/pull/24]
* Fixed some Manifest.txt related madness on Travis.

== 1.20.1 / 2013-01-26

* New MIME Types:
  * Apple iWork document types added by Hans de Graaff
    (application/x-iwork-keynote-sffkey, .key;
    application/x-iwork-pages-sffpages, .pages;
    application/x-iwork-numbers-sffnumbers, .numbers).
    {#20}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issue/20]
  * epub, ibooks, mobi, and DMG content types by Mauricio
    Linhares (mac:application/x-apple-diskimage, .dmg; application/epub\+zip,
    .epub; application/x-ibooks\+zip, .ibooks; application/x-mobipocket-ebook,
    .mobi). {#22}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issue/22]
  * rss content type by Garret Alfert (application/rss\+xml, .rss).
    {#23}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issue/23]
  * Added or updated MIME types from the latest IANA list.
* Fixed MIME Types:
  * Excel macro-enabled spreadsheets had an incorrect extension. Thanks to
    Rafael Belvederese for reporting this issue.
    {#21}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issue/21]
* Enabled for use with travis.
* Enabled gem signing.
* Fixed an error related to MIME type downloads.
* This was previously published as 1.20, but I had forgotten some attributions.

== 1.19 / 2012-06-20
* New MIME Types:
  * XCF Gnome Images (image/x-xcf, image/x-compressed-xcf; .xcf).
    {#17}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issue/17]
  * Types reported in
    {#12}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/12]:
    * DV (video/x-dv; .dv)
    * IVF (video/x-ivf; .ivf)
    * Matroska (video/x-matroska; .mkv)
    * Motion JPEG (video/x-motion-jpeg; .mjpg)
    * RealMedia (official; application/vnd.rn-realmedia; .rm)
* New extensions:
  * dcm (application/dicom);
    {#16}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issue/16].
  * Types reported in
    {#12}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/12]:
    * 3g2, 3gpp2 (video/3gpp2)
    * mpeg (video/mpeg)
    * mxf (application/mxf)
    * ts (video/MP2T)
    * ogg (video/ogg)
* Fixed MIME Types:
  * Adobe AIR application installer packages was missing a hyphen.
    {#13}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issue/13]
  * Types reported in
    {#12}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/12]:
    * audio/x-pn-realaudio extension is .ra, not .rm.
* Resolved {#8}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/8].
  Apparently some people run the tests on Linux. Imagine that.

== 1.18 / 2012-03-20
* New MIME Types:
  * Types reported in
    #{6}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/6]:
    * CoffeeScript (text/x-coffeescript; .coffee; 8bit).
    * AIR (application/vnd.adobe.air-applicationinstaller-package\+zip, .air; base64).
    * WOFF (application/font-woff; .woff; base64).
    * TrueType (application/x-font-truetype; .ttf; base64).
    * OpenType (application/x-font-opentype; .otf; base64).
  * WebM (audio/webm, video/webm; .webm).
    {#11}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/11.]
* New extensions:
  * f4v/f4p (video/mp4, used by Adobe); f4a/fb4 (audio/mp4, used by Adobe).
* Bug Fixes:
  * It was pointed out that Licence.txt was incorrectly named. Fixed by
    renaming to Licence.rdoc (from Issue/Pull Request
    {#8}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/8]).
  * It was pointed out that a plan to have the test output generated
    automatically never went through.
    {#10}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/10]

== 1.17.2 / 2011-10-25
* Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed an issue with Ruby 1.9 and file encoding.

== 1.17.1 / 2011-10-23
* Minor Enhancements:
  * Implemented modern 'hoe' semantics.
  * Switched to minitest instead of test/unit.
  * Converted documentation from .txt to .rdoc.
  * Removed setup.rb.
    {#3}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/3]
  * Should no longer complain about missing RubyGems keys
    {#2}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/2]
  * Added .mp4 and .mpg4 as recognized extensions for
    (application|audio|video)/mp4 per RFC4337.
    {#1}[https://github.com/mime-types/ruby-mime-types/issues/1]
  * Added audio/x-aac and .aac per RubyForge issue #28054.
  * Made it much easier to update MIME types from this point forward.
  * Updated MIME types from IANA.

== 1.16
* Made compatible with Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, and 1.9.1.
* Switched to the 'hoe' gem system and added a lot of build-time tools.
* Updated the MIME types to the list based on the values in the Perl library
  version 1.27. Also updated based on external source information and bug
  reports.
* This is the last planned version of MIME::Types 1.x. Work will be
  starting soon on MIME::Types 2.x with richer data querying mechanisms
  and support for external data sources.

== 1.15
* Removed lib/mime/type.rb to form a single MIME::Types database source. It
  is unlikely that one will ever need MIME::Type without MIME::Types.
* Re-synchronized the MIME type list with the sources, focusing primarily on
  the IANA list.
* Added more detailed source information for MIME::Type objects.
* Changed MIME::Types from a module to a class with a default instance. There
  should be no difference in usage.
* Removed MIME::Types::DATA_VERSION; it is now an attribute on the
  MIME::Types instance.
* NOTE: Synchronization with the Perl version of MIME::Types is no longer a
  priority as of this release. The data format and information has changed.
* Removed MIME::Types.by_suffix and MIME::Types.by_mediatype.

== 1.13.1
* Fixed a problem with the installer running tests. This now works.
* Improved the implementation of MIME::Type.signature?
* Moved code around to use the class << self idiom instead of always
  prepending the module/class name.
* Added two new best-guess implementations of functions found in Perl's
  MIME::Types implementation (1.13). Do not rely on these until the purpose
  and implementation is stabilised.
* Updated the MIME list to reflect changes noted by
  Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.
* Added a new constant to MIME::Types, DATA_VERSION. This will allow the Ruby
  version number to be updated separately from the Perl version while keeping
  the MIME Type list version in sync.

== 1.13
  ! WARNING: This version changes the API of MIME::Types !
  ! WARNING: This version is compatible with Ruby 1.8 and higher ONLY !
* Removed dependency on InstallPackage; offering 1.13 as either .tar.gz or
  .gem.
* Split into two files, mime/type.rb and mime/types.rb. This will make
  maintaining the list of changes easier.
* Changed the MIME::Type construction API. Accepts only a single String
  argument (but does no named type-checking) and yields self.
* Removed private methods #init_extensions, #init_encoding, and #init_system
  and replaced with #extensions=, #encoding=, and #system=.
* Added #default_encoding to return 'quoted-printable' or 'base64' depending
  on the media type of the MIME type.
* Added #raw_media_type and #raw_sub_type to provide the non-simplified
  versions of the media type and subtype.
* Alternative constructors MIME::Type.from_array, MIME::Type.from_hash, and
  MIME::Type.from_mime_type added to compensate for the removal of named type
  checking in the original constructor.
* Added #to_str, #to_a, and #to_hash methods. The latter two will provide
  output suitable for use in #from_array and #from_hash.
* Removed "binary" encoding and enforced the use of a valid encoding string.
* Added #system? returning true if the MIME::Type is an OS-specific
  MIME::Type.
* Added #platform? returning true if the MIME::Type is an OS-specific
  MIME::Type for the current RUBY_PLATFORM.
* Added #like? returning true if the simplified type matches the other value
  provided. #<'application/x-excel'>.like?('application/excel') is true.
* Added #complete? returning true if the MIME::Type specifies an extension
  list.
* Updated the MIME type list to reflect additions by Mark Overmeer for Perl's
  MIME::Types 1.12 and the official IANA list as of 2004.04.06. A number of
  formerly "registered" MIME types are now no longer registered (e.g.,
  application/excel is now application/x-excel). This ensures that the
  simplified type still works with applications, but does not report an
  unregistered type as registered.
* Restored MIME type list to Mark Overmeer's format to facilitate easy
  exchange between the two projects.
* Added additional unit tests from Mark Overmeer's 1.12 version.

== 1.07
* Changed version numbering to match Perl MIME::Types 1.07.
* Re-synchronized with Mark Overmeer's list in Perl PMIME::Types 1.07.
* [NN Poster] updated the attributes for the PGP types.

== 1.005
* Changed to Phil Thomson's InstallPackage.
* Added several types from Perl MIME::Types 1.005.
* Cleaned up data format; some data formats will show up with proper data now.

== 1.004
* Updated to match Perl MIME::Types 1.004, links credited to Dan Puro. Adds
  new reference list to http://www.indiana.edu/cgi-bin-local/mimetypes
* Removed InvalidType and replaced with TypeError.
* Changed instances of #type to #class.
* Cleaned up how simplified versions are created.

== 1.003
* Initial release based on Perl MIME::Types 1.003.
