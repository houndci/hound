  # All JavaScript must be executed in a context. This context consists of a global scope containing the
  # standard JavaScript objectsÂ¨and functions like Object, String, Array, as well as any objects or
  # functions from Ruby which have been embedded into it from the containing enviroment. E.g.
  #
  #     V8::Context.new do |cxt|
  #         cxt['num'] = 5
  #         cxt.eval('num + 5') #=> 10
  #     end
  #
  # The same object may appear in any number of contexts, but only one context may be executing JavaScript code
  # in any given thread. If a new context is opened in a thread in which a context is already opened, the second
  # context will "mask" the old context e.g.
  #
  #   six = 6
  #   Context.new do |cxt|
  #     cxt['num'] = 5
  #     cxt.eval('num') # => 5
  #     Context.new do |cxt|
  #       cxt['num'] = 10
  #       cxt.eval('num') # => 10
  #       cxt.eval('++num') # => 11
  #     end
  #     cxt.eval('num') # => 5
