## Contributing

*Note*: Split requires Ruby 1.9.2 or higher. 

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Add documentation if necessary.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
* Discussion at the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/split-ruby)
