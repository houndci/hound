# Runs code at a later time
#
# Basic usage:
#
#     Scheduler.run_in(5) { do_stuff }  # <- calls do_stuff 5 seconds from now
#
# Scheduled events run in sequence in a separate thread, the main thread continues on.
# That means you may need to #join the scheduler if the main thread is only waiting on scheduled events to run.
#
#     Scheduler.join
#
# Basic usage is through a singleton instance, its methods are available as class methods, as shown above.
# One could also instantiate separate instances which would get you separate run threads, but generally there's no point in it.
