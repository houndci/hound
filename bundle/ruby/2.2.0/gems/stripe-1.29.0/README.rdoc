== Documentation

{Ruby API Docs}[https://stripe.com/docs/api/ruby#intro]

== Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the gem. If
you just want to use the Stripe Ruby bindings, you should run:

  gem install stripe

If you want to build the gem from source:

  gem build stripe.gemspec

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.7 or above. (Ruby 1.8.6 may work if you load
  ActiveSupport.) For Ruby versions before 1.9.2, you'll need to add this to your Gemfile:

    if Gem::Version.new(RUBY_VERSION) < Gem::Version.new('1.9.2')
      gem 'rest-client', '~> 1.6.8'
    end


* rest-client, json

== Bundler

If you are installing via bundler, you should be sure to use the https
rubygems source in your Gemfile, as any gems fetched over http could potentially be
compromised in transit and alter the code of gems fetched securely over https:

  source 'https://rubygems.org'

  gem 'rails'
  gem 'stripe'

== Development

Run all tests:

    bundle exec rake

Run a single test suite:

    bundle exec ruby -Ilib/ test/stripe/util_test.rb

Run a single test:

    bundle exec ruby -Ilib/ test/stripe/util_test.rb -n /should.convert.names.to.symbols/
