	[52bb3eef00f0]

	* Rakefile.cross:
	Explicitly set the gcc-toolchain, instead of deriving from the rake-
	compiler config.

	Now, that we use the libpq.dll (instead of static linking), we can
	mix the gcc-toolchains. So we better build the dll with the newer
	mingw-w64 toolchain (instead of the old mingw32) and build only the
	extension for ruby-1.9 with the old mingw32-gcc.

	spec/pg/connection_spec.rb:
	Revert commit e0492d4 "Ensure a query is canceled, if a thread is
	about to be killed."

	This is due to this discussion: https://groups.google.com/d/topic
	/ruby-pg/5_ylGmog1S4/discussion

	We were using rb_thread_call_without_gvl() with an ubf which
	canceled the query currently being processed. This turned out to be
	incompatible with possibly registered signal handlers (by
	Signal.trap). A ubf is unconditionally invoked if ANY signal fires
	on a process (eg even: USR1 or PROF) and Ruby has handlers
	registered. Cancelling queries in those conditions does no make
	sense.

	This commit re-enables Connection#async_exec based on the async API
	for all ruby versions, because async_exec allowes cancelation of
	queries by signals like Control+C.

	Thanks to Sam Saffron for highlighting this issue.

	* lib/pg.rb, lib/pg/connection.rb, spec/lib/helpers.rb,
	spec/pg/connection_spec.rb:
	Improve Connection#copy_data:
	- ensure and verify a clean exec status for each test case
	- add error PG::NotAllCopyDataRetrieved and a spec for this case
	- fix input/output naming in the specs
	- use ArgumentError instead of PG::Error in case of non-COPY statement
	[b0fd97e58a9a]

	* History.rdoc, lib/pg.rb:
	Bump VERSION to 0.16.1 and prepare History.rdoc for release.
	[c2bbdcd4ef0f]

	* lib/pg/connection.rb:
	Fix examples of conn#copy_data and improve the documentation.

	* ext/gvl_wrappers.h, ext/pg_connection.c:
	Wrap PQisBusy to be called without GVL. It could trigger the notice
	callback.
	[d93b3ddc69ff]

	* ext/gvl_wrappers.h, ext/pg_connection.c:
	Wrap all PQsend* functions to be called without GVL.

	These functions could trigger the notice callback when some notice
	is yet in the buffer. The notice callback needs to be called without
	GVL since it always reaquires the GLV. This fixes issue #171.

2013-08-19  Lars Kanis  <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

	* spec/pg/connection_spec.rb:

	stack method calls.
	[8255d4f73334]

2013-08-15  Lars Kanis  <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

	* Rakefile.cross:
	Use RbConfig::CONFIG['CC'] instead of ['host'] for determining cross
	compilation platform.

	This is 'i586-mingw32msvc-gcc' versus 'i586-pc-mingw32msvc'.
	[fbee9586e8f7]

2013-08-14  Lars Kanis  <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

	[f19e8b3fc659]

	* ext/pg_result.c, spec/pg/result_spec.rb:
	Use nil as PG::Error#result in case of a NULL-result from libpq.

	This previously returned a PG::Result object with internal NULL
	pointer, that caused a misleading error "result has been cleared",
	when accessed.

	This fixes issue 166 : https://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/issue/166
	[de6bee6a208c]

	* ext/pg.h, ext/pg_connection.c, spec/pg/connection_spec.rb:
	Recalculate the timeout of conn#wait_for_notify and conn#block in
	case of socket events that require re-runs of select().

	This previously caused a timeout higher than the given value,
	because the timeout was set to the original value for every re-run.
	[854b22230eba]

	* spec/pg/connection_spec.rb:
	Await a established connection to ensure the received errors match
	exactly.

	This test failed on Windows x64.

	New method: PG::Result#check. (fixes #123)

	This method exposes a previously internal-only function for checking
	the status of a PG::Result, primarily for people using the async
	interface. The check is done for you if you're using the synchronous
	interface, but there was no way to get the same behavior for results
	fetched via PG::Connection#get_result.

	 Fix PGconn#async_exec and PGconn#get_last_result to properly clear
	all results when an exception is raised. Before, the connection
	could be left in a state that is not ready for new commands.

	 Also, change PGconn#get_result to not raise an exception when the
	result is in an error state. You can still check the result object
	for an error, but it's not appropriate to raise an exception,
	because that could prevent the caller from properly clearing all

	[449d54289f07]

2008-01-17  Jeff Davis  <davis.jeffrey@gmail.com>

	[d6d19e5371d4] <stable>

2008-01-08  Jeff Davis  <davis.jeffrey@gmail.com>

	* ext/pg.c:
	Added:
	  * conn.set_client_encoding
	  * conn.get_client_encoding

	 get_client_encoding returns a string, and the PQclientEncoding
	function returns an encoding ID, which is why I didn't use the name
	client_encoding. That leaves room later to add a wrapper for the
	libpq PQclientEncoding if there is a need, without a name conflict.
	[1fd8b2aaac4c]

	* ext/pg.c:
	Added:
	 * conn.make_empty_pgresult(status)

	PQexecParams if optional parameters are passed.

	Change conn.send_query to use PQsendQuery if no parameters are
	passed, and use PQsendQueryParams if optional parameters are passed.

	Split 'ruby-pg' module and 'postgres' module into separate parts of
	the repository. They will be maintained separately, and be released
	as separate gems from this point forward.

	One reason for this change is because we need separate gems. If we
	distribute both modules as one gem, the documentation is not
	properly generated due to class name conflicts.

	Another reason is to reduce confusion between the two modules.

	Also, I don't plan on making many improvements (aside from bugfixes
	and portability issues) to the old 'postgres' code. I'd like to get
	it to a stable state, and leave it alone. Meanwhile, the 'pg' module
	can be developed on a faster timeline.
