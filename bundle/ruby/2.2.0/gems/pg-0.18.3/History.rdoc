== v0.17.1 [2013-12-18] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Bugfixes:

- Fix compatibility with signal handlers defined in Ruby. This reverts
  cancelation of queries running on top of the blocking libpq API (like
  Connection#exec) in case of signals. As an alternative the #async_exec
  can be used, which is reverted to use the non-blocking API, again.
- Wrap PQcancel to be called without GVL. It internally waits for
  the canceling connection.

Enhancements:

- Add method PG::Connection#copy_data.
- Add a Gemfile to allow installation of dependencies with bundler.

  and escape_identifier (#163).
- Use nil as PG::Error#result in case of a NULL-result from libpq (#166).
- Recalculate the timeout of conn#wait_for_notify and conn#block in case
  of socket events that require re-runs of select().

Documentation fixes:

- Fix non working example for PGresult#error_field.

Enhancements:

- Add unique exception classes for each PostgreSQL error type (#5).
- Return result of the block in conn#transaction instead of nil (#158).

- Add an example of how to insert array data using a prepared statement (#145).
- Add continous integration tests on travis-ci.org.
- Add PG::Result#each_row for iterative over result sets by row. Thanks to
  Aaron Patterson for the patch.
