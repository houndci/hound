# jquery-rails

jQuery! For Rails! So great.

This gem provides:

  * jQuery 1 and jQuery 2
  * the jQuery UJS adapter
  * assert_select_jquery to test jQuery responses in Ruby tests

## Versions

Starting with v2.1, the jquery-rails gem follows these version guidelines
to provide more control over your app's jQuery version from your Gemfile:

```
patch version bump = updates to jquery-ujs, jquery-rails, and patch-level updates to jQuery
minor version bump = minor-level updates to jQuery
major version bump = major-level updates to jQuery and updates to Rails which may be backwards-incompatible
```

See [VERSIONS.md](VERSIONS.md) to see which versions of jquery-rails bundle which
versions of jQuery.

## Installation

The jquery and jquery-ujs files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. If they're not already in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` by default, add these lines:

```js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
```

If you want to use jQuery 2, you can require `jquery2` instead:

```js
//= require jquery2
//= require jquery_ujs
```

For jQuery UI, we recommend the [jquery-ui-rails](https://github.com/joliss/jquery-ui-rails) gem, as it includes the jquery-ui css and allows easier customization.

*As of v3.0, jquery-rails no longer includes jQuery UI. Use the
jquery-ui-rails gem above.*

## Contributing

Feel free to open an issue ticket if you find something that could be improved. A couple notes:

* If it's an issue pertaining to the jquery-ujs javascript, please report it to the [jquery-ujs project](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs).

* If the jQuery scripts are outdated (i.e. maybe a new version of jquery was released yesterday), feel free to open an issue and prod us to get that thing updated. However, for security reasons, we won't be accepting pull requests with updated jQuery scripts.
