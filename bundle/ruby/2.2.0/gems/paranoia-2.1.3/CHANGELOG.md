# paranoia Changelog

## 2.1.0 (2015-01-23)

### Major changes

* `#destroyed?` is no longer overridden. Use `#paranoia_destroyed?` for the existing behaviour. [Washington Luiz](https://github.com/huoxito)
* `#persisted?` is no longer overridden.
* ActiveRecord 4.0 no longer has `#destroy!` as an alias for `#really_destroy`.
* `#destroy` will now raise an exception if called on a readonly record.
* `#destroy` on a hard deleted record is now a successful noop.
* `#destroy` on a new record will set deleted_at (previously this raised an error)
* `#destroy` and `#delete` always return self when successful.

### Bug Fixes

* Calling `#destroy` twice will not hard-delete records. Use `#really_destroy` if this is desired.
* Fix errors on non-paranoid has_one dependent associations
