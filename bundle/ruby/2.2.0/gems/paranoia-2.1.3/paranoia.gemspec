You would use either plugin / gem if you wished that when you called destroy on an Active Record object that it didn't actually destroy it, but just \"hid\" the record. Paranoia does this by setting a deleted_at field to the current time when you destroy a record, and hides it by scoping all queries on your model to only include records which do not have a deleted_at field."
