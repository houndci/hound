module ActionController
  # Mix this module in to your controller, and all actions in that controller
  # will be able to stream data to the client as it's written.
  #
  #   class MyController < ActionController::Base
  #     include ActionController::Live
  #
  #     def stream
  #       response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/event-stream'
  #       100.times {
  #         response.stream.write "hello world\n"
  #         sleep 1
  #       }
  #     ensure
  #       response.stream.close
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # There are a few caveats with this use. You *cannot* write headers after the
  # response has been committed (Response#committed? will return truthy).
  # Calling +write+ or +close+ on the response stream will cause the response
  # object to be committed. Make sure all headers are set before calling write
  # or close on your stream.
  #
  # You *must* call close on your stream when you're finished, otherwise the
  # socket may be left open forever.
  #
  # The final caveat is that your actions are executed in a separate thread than
  # the main thread. Make sure your actions are thread safe, and this shouldn't
  # be a problem (don't share state across threads, etc).
  module Live
    # This class provides the ability to write an SSE (Server Sent Event)
    # to an IO stream. The class is initialized with a stream and can be used
    # to either write a JSON string or an object which can be converted to JSON.
    #
    # Writing an object will convert it into standard SSE format with whatever
    # options you have configured. You may choose to set the following options:
    #
    #   1) Event. If specified, an event with this name will be dispatched on
    #   the browser.
    #   2) Retry. The reconnection time in milliseconds used when attempting
    #   to send the event.
    #   3) Id. If the connection dies while sending an SSE to the browser, then
    #   the server will receive a +Last-Event-ID+ header with value equal to +id+.
    #
    # After setting an option in the constructor of the SSE object, all future
    # SSEs sent across the stream will use those options unless overridden.
    #
    # Example Usage:
    #
    #   class MyController < ActionController::Base
    #     include ActionController::Live
    #
    #     def index
    #       response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/event-stream'
    #       sse = SSE.new(response.stream, retry: 300, event: "event-name")
    #       sse.write({ name: 'John'})
    #       sse.write({ name: 'John'}, id: 10)
    #       sse.write({ name: 'John'}, id: 10, event: "other-event")
    #       sse.write({ name: 'John'}, id: 10, event: "other-event", retry: 500)
    #     ensure
    #       sse.close
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Note: SSEs are not currently supported by IE. However, they are supported
    # by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
