## Configure Hound on Your Local Development Environment

1. After cloning the repository, run the setup script

    `./bin/setup`

1. Sign up for a free [ngrok] account and create a `~/.ngrok` file with the
   following:

    `auth_token: <your-token>`

1. Launch ngrok with a custom subdomain on port 5000.

    `ngrok -subdomain=<your-initials>-hound 5000`

1. Set the `HOST` variable in your `.env` to your ngrok host, e.g.
   `<your-initials>.ngrok.com`.

1. Change `ENABLE_HTTPS` to 'yes' in the .env file.

1. Log into your GitHub account and go to your
   [application settings].

1. Under the Developer applications panel - Click on "Register new
   application" and fill in the details:

    * Application Name: Hound Development
    * Homepage URL: `https://<your-initials>-hound.ngrok.com`
    * Authorization Callback URL: `http://<your-initials>-hound.ngrok.com`

1. On the confirmation screen, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to
   `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env` file.

1. Back on the [application settings] page, click "Generate new token" and fill
   in token details:

    * Token description: Hound Development
    * Select scopes: `repo` and `user:email`

1. On the confirmation screen, copy the generated token to `HOUND_GITHUB_TOKEN`
   in the `.env` file. Also update `HOUND_GITHUB_USERNAME` to be your username.

1. Run `foreman start`. Foreman will start the web server and
   the resque background job queue. NOTE: `rails server` will not load the
   appropriate environment variables and you'll get a "Missing `secret_key_base`
   for 'development' environment" error.
