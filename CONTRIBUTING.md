## Configure Hound on Your Local Development Environment

1. After cloning the repository, run the setup script: `./bin/setup`

1. Make sure that Postgres, and Redis, are both installed and running locally.

1. Log into your GitHub account and go to your [developer application settings].

1. Under the Developer applications panel - Click on "Register new application"
   and fill in the details:

    * Application Name: Hound Development
    * Homepage URL: `http://localhost:5000`
    * Authorization Callback URL: `http://localhost:5000`

1. On the confirmation screen, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to
   `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env.local` file.

1. Run `foreman start`. Foreman will start the web server and the resque
   background job queue. **NOTE**: `rails server` will not load the appropriate
   environment variables and you'll get a "Missing `secret_key_base` for
   'development' environment" error. Similarly, `heroku local` and `forego start`
   will fail to properly load `.env.local`.

1. Open `localhost:5000` in a browser.

## Setup Ngrok to Allow Webhooks

Ngrok allows Hound to receive webhooks from GitHub. If you'd like to develop or
test a feature involving GitHub sending a pull request notification to your
local Hound server you'll need to have ngrok or something similar set up.

To get started with ngrok, sign up for an [ngrok] account and configure ngrok
locally by installing ngrok and running:

```sh
ngrok authtoken <your-token>
```

1. Launch ngrok on port 5000 (we recommend running ngrok with a custom subdomain
   for easy and persistent configuration, but this requires a paid ngrok account.
   You can still run Hound with a free ngrok account, but it will require keeping
   the GitHub developer application configuration and your `.env.local` files up
   to date if your ngrok subdomain changes).

   * If you're using a custom subdomain:
     `ngrok http -subdomain=<your-initials>-hound 5000`

   * If you're using a free ngrok plan: `ngrok http 5000`

1. Set the `HOST` variable in your `.env.local` to your ngrok host, e.g.
   `<your-subdomain>.ngrok.io`.

1. Change `ENABLE_HTTPS` to 'yes' in the `.env.local` file. You might need to allow
  insecure access to localhost (see [this link] for a possible workaround).

1. Log into your GitHub account and go to your [developer application settings].

1. Under the Developer applications panel - Click on "Register new
   application" and fill in the details:

    * Application Name: Hound Development
    * Homepage URL: `https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok.io`
    * Authorization Callback URL: `https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok.io`

1. On the confirmation screen, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to
   `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env.local` file.

1. On the [personal access token] page, click "Generate new token" and fill in
   token details:

    * Token description: Hound Development
    * Select scopes: `repo` and `user:email`

1. On the confirmation screen, copy the generated token to `HOUND_GITHUB_TOKEN`
   in the `.env.local` file. Also update `HOUND_GITHUB_USERNAME` to be your username.

1. Run `foreman start`. Foreman will start the web server and the resque
   background job queue. **NOTE**: `rails server` will not load the appropriate
   environment variables and you'll get a "Missing `secret_key_base` for
   'development' environment" error. Similarly, `heroku local` and `forego start`
   will fail to properly load `.env.local`.

1. Open `https://<your-subdomain>.ngrok.io` in a browser.

## Testing

1. Set up your `development` environment as per above.
1. Run `rake` to execute the full test suite.

To test Stripe payments on staging use this fake credit card number.

## Linters

The main Hound app (this app) receives PR hooks from GitHub, then it
communicates with the [Linters](https://github.com/houndci/linters) app
(or a few individual linter services) to review changed files in the PR.
Linters communicate back with violations they found, and the Hound app sends
comments back to GitHub.

Here is the list of all the linters and where to find them,
as well as any default configuration they might use:

### Writing a Linter

Linters check code snippets for style violations. They operate by polling a
Resque queue.

Linter jobs are created with the following arguments:

* `commit_sha` - The git commit SHA of the code snippet. This should be passed
  through to the outbound queue.
* `config` - The configuration for the linter. This will be linter specific.
* `content` - The source code to check for violations.
* `filename` - The name of the source file for the code snippet. This should be
  passed through to the outbound queue.
* `linter_name` - A string that identifies which linter is assigned to this
  linter job. This must be passed through to the outbound queue unmodified.
* `patch` - The patch content from GitHub for the file being reviewed. This
  should be passed through to the outbound queue.
* `pull_request_number` - The GitHub pull request number. This should be passed
  through to the outbound queue.

Once linting is complete, resulting violations should be posted to the outbound
"CompletedFileReviewJob" queue:

* `violations` - An array of violation objects. Each violation requires the
  following:
  * `line` - The line number where the violation occurred.
  * `message` - A message describing the violation. This will be the contents
    of the Pull Request comment.
* `filename` - The name of the source file for the code snippet. This is
  provided by the inbound queue.
* `commit_sha` - The git commit SHA of the code snippet. This is provided by the
  inbound queue.
* `linter_name` - A string that identifies which linter is assigned to this
  linter job. This is provided by the inbound queue.
* `patch` - The patch content from GitHub for the file being reviewed. This is
  provided by the inbound queue.

If the given `config` is invalid, the invalid file should be posted to the
outbound `ReportInvalidConfigJob` queue:

* `commit_sha` - The git commit SHA of the code snippet. This is provided by the
  inbound queue.
* `linter_name` - The name of the linter that received an invalid config file.
* `pull_request_number` - The GitHub pull request number. This is provided by
  the inbound queue.
