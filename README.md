Take care of pesky code reviews with a trusty [Hound](http://houndci.com).

Hound reviews GitHub pull requests for style guide violations. [View the style

## Configure the Hound Service

We run Hound as a hosted service at [houndci.com].

If you are setting up Hound for the first time, see the [configuration] page.

If you have questions about the service, see our [FAQ] or email [hound@thoughtbot.com].

## Configure Hound on Your Local Development Environment

1. After cloning the repository, run the setup script `./bin/setup`
2. Log into your GitHub account and go to the
   [Applications under Personal settings](https://github.com/settings/applications).
3. Under the Developer applications panel - Click on "Register new
   application"
4. Point [ngrok] to your local Hound instance:
   `ngrok -subdomain=<your-initials>-hound 5000`
5. Fill in the application details:
  * Application Name: Hound Development
  * Homepage URL: http://<your-initials>-hound.ngrok.com
  * Authorization Callback URL: http://<your-initials>-hound.ngrok.com
6. On the confirmation screen, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to
   `.env`. Note the setup script copies `.sample.env` to `.env` for you, if the
   file does not exist.
7. Run `foreman start`. Foreman will start the web server and
   the resque background job queue. NOTE: `rails server` will not load the
   appropriate environment variables and you'll get a "Missing `secret_key_base`
   for 'development' environment" error.
