# Development

Steps for setting up your development environment:

1. Install [localtunnel](http://progrium.com/localtunnel/) locally so that whatever you run on your local server can be made publicly
   accessible
  - Run `gem install localtunnel`
  - Run `localtunnel 5000` and `foreman start` to confirm that localtunnel works correctly on port
5000
  - Ctrl+C to kill localtunnel


2. Register a new application with GitHub
  - Visit your GitHub account page and click Applications on the left menu
  - Click Register New Application
  - Name your new application Hound Development
  - Enter whatever you want in the Main URL and Callback URL fields. You will
update these fields every time you run localtunnel.

To run your development environment:

1. Run `foreman start`
2. Run `localtunnel 5000` (or whatever port Foreman is using)
3. Using the GitHub UI, update your application's Main URL and Callback URL
   to the URL generated by localtunnel
4. Navigate to the localtunnel URL to confirm that everything is working
