Mnd-Hound
=========

Hound is a bot reviewing pull requests in activated projects for styleguide violations.

Activate your mynewsdesk repo today at:

https://mnd-hound.herokuapp.com

### Styleguides

Styleguides are based on Hound defaults with overrides under `config/style_guides/mynewsdesk`

### App specific styleguides

Overriding styleguide can be done in individual projects by adding a .hound.yml file.
However this is highly discouraged as we want to keep style consistency for the all
mynewsdesk projects. More info on configuration at:

https://houndci.com/configuration

### Y U NO?

If you find it hard to sleep at night due to horrible style ideas being forced upon
you by the terror of the hound: Try creating a Pull Request and get the majority
of the team to agree with you in the comments.

Now back to the original README...
